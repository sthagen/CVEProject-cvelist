Versions starting from 2.1.2 to before 4.4.1, are vulnerable to a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. When using the Easy Logging feature on Linux and macOS, the Connector reads logging configuration from a user-provided file. On Linux and macOS, the Connector verifies that the configuration file can be written to only by its owner. That check was vulnerable to a TOCTOU race condition and failed to verify that the file owner matches the user running the Connector. This could allow a local attacker with write access to the configuration file or the directory containing it to overwrite the configuration and gain control over logging level and output location. This issue has been patched in version 4.4.1."
