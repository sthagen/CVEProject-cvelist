You greatly reduce the risk of this issue by restricting access to the management web interface to only trusted internal IP addresses according to our recommended  critical deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .\n\nThis issue affects Cloud NGFW.
