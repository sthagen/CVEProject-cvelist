The attacker would need valid user credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) of certain OpenAPI operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a crafted OpenAPI function call with valid credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute OpenAPI operations that are reserved for the Administrator user, including the creation and deletion of user labels."
